		<h1>Vibing to fast fast fast Techno</h1>
		<p>
		There's something about vibing to fast fast fast techno, that hits no mattter how caffeine-addled or tired I am. It just gets me into a flow state, nothing else exists besides the beats. I need to figure out how to make good fast techno, there aren't enough really good songs.
